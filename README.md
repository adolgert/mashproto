# Prototype for MASH Modularity

Thesis: If each module is a finite state machine, then
the modules will be both separate and efficient.

It's a prototype, so we prove or disprove this,
and throw it away.

## Types of Modularity

We talked about a few types of modularity, which are:

  * FSM (finite state machine)
  * Bare module API
  * subject-observer
  * publish-subscribe
  * push to queue
